FTB Guides 3 is your very own in-game guidebook framework for creating in-game guides, support docs, instructions, to-lists, etc. With rich in-built markdown support ([CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#introduction)), categories with nesting, Minecraft item rendering, resource pack based, multi-language supported and more, it's a great choice for your next modpack!

## Features

- Full markdown support ([CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#introduction))
- Categories with nesting
- Minecraft item rendering
- Language support
- In-game GUI
- Searching
- Tagging
- Built-in JEI/REI/EMI support (if installed) to display recipes within a guide

## Usage

To get started using FTB Guides, you'll want to have it installed and have a resource-pack or a mod that can dynamically load resource packs from the file system.

Once you've got this sorted, you'll need the following:

- A folder in your resource pack called `assets/{namespace}/guides/{language}`. By default, we recommend using `en_us` as this is what our system will fall back to if the user's language is not available.
- Inside of this folder, you'll want to have a guide index file: `guide.json`. See below for an example.
- Once you've got your index setup, you can start adding guides! It's as simple as create a new markdown file (`my-guide.md`)

This is a sample `guide.json` file. It has a mandatory `categories` section, and an optional `theme` section, which can be used to provide colour for your guide pages.

```json
{
  "categories": [
    { "id":  "default", "name":  "Sample Guide", "icon": "item:minecraft:stone" },
    { "id":  "category1", "name":  "Category One", "icon": "ftblibrary:icons/heart" },
    { "id":  "category2", "name":  "Category Two" }
  ],
  "theme": {
    "background_color": "#80000000",
    "index_background_color": "#212121",
    "gui_line_color": "#606060",
    "text_color": "#FFFFFF",
    "links_color": "#98D9FF",
    "code_color": "#EBCB8B"
  }
}
```

The colours provided above are the defaults, and can be omitted if you're happy to use those.

The `categories` section must be provided, and lists each category in your guide, in the order you want it to appear in the GUI index. Each entry has a mandatory `id` and `name` field, and an optional `icon` field.

### Markdown Files

You can add markdown files anywhere within your namespace. They will most commonly go at the same folder level as the `guide.json` file, but they can be placed into subfolders if you want. This has no effect on in-game rendering (categories are used for that); it's just a way of organising files.

Each markdown file is required to have a metadata (aka "front matter") block at the top of the file. This is an SNBT compound tag that must at the very least contain a `title` key. The optional `category` key corresponds to the category `id` fields in the `guide.json` file described above.

Note that although SNBT normally requires the compound tag to be enclosed in curly braces, they're optional here, for convenience.

#### Example metadata block

```markdown
---
category: "cat1",  // Optional - defaults to "default"
title: "Test 1",  // Required
order: 1, // Optional - if omitted page is added at end of list
icon: "item:minecraft:book" // Optional
---

# Welcome to my guide book!
```

#### Available metadata keys

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `category` | String | The category that this guide belongs to. |
| `title` | String | The title of the guide. |
| `order` | Integer | The order of the guide within the category. |
| `icon` | String | The icon to use for the guide. |

### Markdown content

Under the hood FTB Guides uses [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#introduction) for markdown parsing. This means you can use all the features that CommonMark provides, with a couple of exceptions:

#### Images

- Images can not be remote URLs; they must be local to the game's resources
  - This means you can't use `![My Image](https://example.com/image.png)`
  - You can use `![My Image](item:minecraft:diamond)` or `![My Image](minecraft:gui/painting/burning_skull)`

Please see the [FTB Library icon path](#ftb-library-icon-path) section for more information on how to use icons.

### FTB Library icon path

Our library provides a powerful syntax for referencing assets to render. The guides (markdown files) are able to use this to render items, blocks, fluids or just general resources.

`// TODO: Link out or describe the syntax`

#### Icons

#### Items / Blocks / Fluids

#### Resources

### Categories

Categories are a way to group guides together. They can be nested to create a hierarchy of guides. You can define nested categories by using a `.` to separate the category names.

#### Example category structure

**Standard**
```markdown
---
{
  category: "cat1",
  title: "Test 1",
  "order": 1, // Optional
  "icon": "item:minecraft:book" // Optional
}
---
```

**Nested**
```markdown
---
{
  category: "cat1.test1",
  title: "Test 1A",
  "order": 1, // Optional
  "icon": "item:minecraft:book" // Optional
}
---
```

### Reloading

We support reloading via the `F3 - T` resource reloading hotkey. Please note `/reload` will not work as this is not a client side reload. You will **not** have to restart the game to see changes to your guides.
